# CSIE DIC LAB--Floating Point Number Multiplier
## Floating Point Number Multiplier

Based on **IEEE 754 standard**, the **double-precision** numbers are stored in 64 bits.  

Should try to maximize the operation frequency of this pipeline floating multiplier.  

RTL coding algorithm design.  

Synthesis for gate-level simulation.  

**Cell-based APR Flow** and **post-layout gate-level simulation**.
